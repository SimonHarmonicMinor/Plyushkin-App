- As a user I want to create a budget plan. Each user might have multiple plans.
- As a user I want to invite other users to my budget plan. Each user can be a member of multiple budget plans.
- By default other users can only view the plan they're invited to. If I grant them permissions, they can also add new records there (or update/delete previous ones).
- As a user I want to set currency for my budget plan.
- As a user I want to add new income or expense record to my budget plan.
- Each income/expense record should have a date, a category, amount of money, and an optional description.
- Each category can have a parent category. Therefore, categories can be presented as a tree.
- As a user I want to see the balance of my budget plan for any period of time (in days).
- As a user I want to see visual graph representing income/expense for each category in the tree for any period of time (in days).
